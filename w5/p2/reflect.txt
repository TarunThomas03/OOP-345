The workshop constitutes a comprehensive system for managing collections of books and movies while also incorporating a spell-checking utility. The code is organized into several classes, each with a specific role.

The Book and Movie classes serve as blueprints for storing book and movie information. They encapsulate attributes like title, year, and description and provide methods for accessing and manipulating this data.

The Collection class acts as a container for these book and movie objects, enabling dynamic collection management. Notably, the code implements observer functions for both types of collections, which are invoked whenever new items are added. This design enhances extensibility and modularity.

The SpellChecker class, meanwhile, handles the spell-checking functionality. It reads bad and good words from a file, processes text for spelling errors, and maintains statistics about replacements made during the spell-checking process.

The main program demonstrates the code's functionality by reading data from files, populating collections, and applying exchange rates to prices. Error handling is a key aspect of the program, encompassing scenarios such as file reading failures, incorrect argument counts, and exceptions due to out-of-range index access or issues during the spell-checking process.

In summary, this code embodies good software engineering practices, including encapsulation, abstraction, extensibility, and robust error handling. It provides a well-structured framework for managing and processing book and movie collections while ensuring the accuracy of the textual data through spell-checking.
