In the workshop, I extensively utilized STL algorithms, including for_each, find_if, copy_if, and sort, each tailored to specific tasks such as iterating through elements, locating items based on conditions, copying elements meeting certain criteria, and sorting the entire collection with custom rules. This strategic use of algorithms not only simplified the code but also significantly reduced the time and effort that would otherwise be spent on manually implementing these fundamental operations. The algorithms, designed for reliability, contributed to bug-free code and enhanced the overall readability and comprehensibility of the program. Furthermore, I recognized the potential for improvement by introducing an enum to store field names, allowing compile-time error detection and mitigating issues such as misspellings during the compilation phase. This approach demonstrated the practicality of leveraging standardized algorithms to streamline coding processes and improve code quality.
