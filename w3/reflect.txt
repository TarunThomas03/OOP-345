In Workshop 3, I learned about class templates and their effective design and implementation. The workshop covered concepts like templating class variables, specialization for specific types, instantiation of template classes, specialized member functions, and inheritance between templated classes. The Collection class, part of the workshop, managed statically-allocated arrays of elements with flexibility for different data types and capacities. It tracked its own capacity, size, smallest item, and largest item, enhancing data understanding. Essential public members included functions to retrieve the smallest and largest items, report size and capacity, add items, and display collection contents.

Specializations tailored the class for specific configurations, like Book with a capacity of 10. In Part 2, I encountered the OrderedCollection class, inheriting from Collection and maintaining items in ascending order. This class introduced a shadowed operator+=() function for inserting items into the array while preserving the order.

Through this workshop, I gained insight into class templates' flexibility, specialization for custom behaviors, and the power of inheritance. I faced challenges, but referencing course materials and problem-solving skills helped me overcome them. Overall, Workshop 3 deepened my understanding of C++ templates and their practical applications, enhancing my programming skills and appreciation for their versatility in modern software development.
